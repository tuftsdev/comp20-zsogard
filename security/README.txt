Assignment 4

Everything has been implemented correctly. I've pushed an index.html and images to the master branch. The file contains all sections required for the security assessment of secure-coast-91078.herokuapp.com.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this assignment other than asking Jenny Xu for her source code.

I spent approximately 2 hours on the assignment.
