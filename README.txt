README.txt

1. This Git repository contains various assignments and labs that I wrote for Tufts University's Web Programming class (COMP 20) in Spring 2016.

2. My favorite assignment was Assignment 3 since it combined a lot of the things I learned in the class - Javascript with asynchronous callback functions, Databases (specifically noSQL), Heroku, node.js, and express.js.

3. I've grown a considerable amount since day 1 of the class. On day 1, I didn't know HTML. Now I know some HTML/CSS, I'm comfortable with Git, and know how to write Javascript and work with a sampling of things that enhance JS such as jQuery and node.js.

4. The most important thing I learned in the class was how to search for what I don't know. The class notes and Piazza don't have all the answers, and Googling the solution to a problem that I've encountered was a valuable skill I learned. One example of this is all of the times I encountered a strange, cryptic error on an assignment and had to find post on a forum to learn the fix for it. Another example was learning how to use this "this" keyword which was necessary for some of the callback functions in Assignment 2.

5. After learning an quick and easy-to-pickup noSQL database system such as MongoDB, I'd like to formally learn SQL to become proficient at designing database schemas and querying with the SQL language.
